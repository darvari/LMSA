  ```

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+**
  ```bash
  # Install OpenJDK (Ubuntu/Debian)
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk

  # Verify installation
  java --version  # Should be v11.x or higher
  ```

- **Android Studio and Android SDK**
  1. Download and install Android Studio from [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  2. During installation, ensure "Android SDK" and "Android SDK Platform-Tools" are selected
  3. After installation, open Android Studio and go to **Tools ‚Üí SDK Manager**
  4. Install **Android SDK Platform 30+** and **Android Build Tools 30.0.3+**
  5. Install **Android SDK Command-line Tools** from SDK Manager

- **Git**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
  ```

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:

```bash
# Android SDK paths (adjust paths according to your Android Studio installation)
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator
export CAPACITOR_ANDROID_STUDIO_PATH=$HOME/android-studio/bin/studio
```

Apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Create Project Configuration Files

If starting from minimal structure, create the necessary configuration files:

#### Create package.json
```bash
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "lmsa",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "LM Studio Android - Client app for LM Studio",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npx serve ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/android": "^5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/cli": "^5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/preferences": "^5.0.0",
    "cordova-plugin-secure-storage-echo": "^5.1.1",
    "highlight.js": "^11.11.1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/peterrhone/LMSA.git"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/peterrhone/LMSA/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/peterrhone/LMSA#readme"
}
EOF
```

#### Create capacitor.config.json
```bash
cat > capacitor.config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "appId": "com.lmsa.app",
  "appName": "LMSA",
  "webDir": ".",
  "server": {
    "androidScheme": "https"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all required Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Initialize Capacitor

Initialize Capacitor for your project:
```bash
npx cap init "LMSA" "com.lmsa.app" --web-dir .
```

This command:
- Creates the Capacitor configuration
- Sets up the native Android project structure
- Links your web assets to the native project

### Step 5: Add Android Platform

Add the Android platform to your project:
```bash
npx cap add android
```

This creates the `android/` directory with the native Android project files.

### Step 6: Sync Web Assets

Sync your web assets (HTML, CSS, JS) to the native Android project:
```bash
npx cap sync
```

This command:
- Copies your web files to `android/app/src/main/assets/public/`
- Updates native dependencies
- Ensures plugins are properly configured

### Step 7: Build the Android APK

#### Option A: Build from Command Line
```bash
npx cap build android
```

#### Option B: Build Using Android Studio
1. Open the project in Android Studio:
   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```
2. In Android Studio, click **Build ‚Üí Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) ‚Üí Build APK(s)**
3. Wait for the build to complete

The built APK will be located at:
- **Debug APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (requires signing)

### Step 8: Sign the APK (for Release Builds)

For production releases, you need to sign your APK:

#### Generate a Keystore
```bash
# Create keystore in android directory
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/lmsa-key.keystore -alias lmsa -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Keystore password
- Key alias password (use same as keystore)
- Your name, organization, etc.

#### Configure Signing in Capacitor
Create `capacitor.config.json.signing`:
```bash
cat > capacitor.config.json.signing << 'EOF'
{
  "android": {
    "release": {
      "keystore": "android/lmsa-key.keystore",
      "storePassword": "your_keystore_password",
      "alias": "lmsa",
      "password": "your_key_password"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Build Signed Release APK
```bash
npx cap build android --release
```

### Step 9: Install APK on Device

#### Using ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device
2. Connect device via USB
3. Install the APK:
   ```bash
   # For debug APK
   adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

   # For release APK
   adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

#### Manual Installation
1. Transfer the APK file to your Android device
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in device settings
3. Open the APK file on your device to install

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**"Command 'npx' not found"**
```bash
# Install npx globally
npm install -g npx
```

**"Android SDK not found"**
- Verify `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` is set correctly
- Reinstall Android SDK through Android Studio

**"Capacitor could not find the web assets"**
- Ensure `index.html` exists in the project root
- Run `npx cap sync` again

**Build fails with Gradle errors**
- Clean and rebuild: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
- Update Gradle wrapper: `cd android && ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=8.0`

**Plugin installation issues**
```bash
# Reinstall plugins
npm uninstall cordova-plugin-secure-storage-echo
npm install cordova-plugin-secure-storage-echo
npx cap sync
```

### Additional Configuration

#### Enable Secure Storage Plugin
The app uses secure storage for authentication credentials. This is automatically configured when you run `npx cap sync`, but you can verify the setup:

```bash
# Check if plugin is installed
npx cap plugin ls
```

#### Customize App Icon and Splash Screen
1. Replace `icon.png` with your custom icon (512x512 recommended)
2. Run `npx cap sync` to update the native project
3. Rebuild the APK

### Next Steps

After successfully building and installing the APK:
1. Launch the LMSA app on your Android device
2. Configure connection to your LM Studio server
3. Start chatting with your AI models

For development and testing, you can also run the app in a browser using:
```bash
npm start
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index.html`

## üåê Remote Access & Nginx Configuration

To enable secure remote access with HTTPS and Basic Authentication while resolving CORS issues, follow these steps:

### Setting Up Nginx with SSL and Basic Authentication

1. **Install Nginx and the headers-more module**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx apache2-utils
   sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-headers-more-filter  # Headers-more module
   
   # For CentOS/RHEL, use EPEL repository
   sudo yum install nginx nginx-mod-http-more
   sudo yum install httpd-tools  # For htpasswd utility
   ```

2. **Create a password file for authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new password file (replace 'username' with your desired username)
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
   
   # Add additional users (omit -c flag)
   sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd another_user
   ```

3. **Create SSL certificates** (or use Let's Encrypt):
   ```bash
   # Self-signed certificate for testing
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key \
     -out /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt
   ```

4. **Configure Nginx**:
   Create a configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio` with the following content:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name your.domain.com;  # Replace with your actual domain

  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key;
  
  # Strong SSL settings
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
  
  # Basic Authentication
  auth_basic "Restricted Access";
  auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1234;  # LM Studio server port
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Robust CORS headers for all requests
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,Origin,Accept';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true';

    # Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
      more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Type: text/plain charset=UTF-8';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Length: 0';
      return 204;
    }
  }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your.domain.com;
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

5. **Enable the site and restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Configure firewall** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   ```

### Connecting LMSA to Your Secure Server

1. Open the LMSA app
2. Go to Settings
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `https://your.domain.com`)
4. Enter username and password in the authentication section
5. Test the connection

### Security Notes

- Using Basic Authentication with HTTPS ensures your credentials are encrypted in transit
- The CORS headers allow the mobile app to communicate with your server
- For production use, consider obtaining a proper SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Regularly update your passwords for better security
- The headers-more module is required for proper CORS header handling
