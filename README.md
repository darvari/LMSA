## üöÄ Getting Started

### Run Locally in Your Browser

You can run LMSA as a web app for local testing and development:

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ and npm v8+

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peterrhone/LMSA.git
   cd LMSA
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/index.html
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the LMSA APK from Source

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer (or similar Linux distribution)
- Node.js v16+ and npm v8+
- JDK 11+
- Android SDK 30+ (via Android Studio)
- Git

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
```bash
# Install Node.js and npm if not installed
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs openjdk-11-jdk git

# Verify installations
node --version  # Should be v16.x or higher
npm --version   # Should be v8.x or higher
java --version  # Should be v11.x or higher
```

### Step 2: Install Android Studio and Android SDK
1. Download and install Android Studio from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. During installation, ensure "Android SDK" and "Android SDK Platform-Tools" are selected
3. After installation, open Android Studio and go to "SDK Manager"
4. Install Android SDK Platform 30 (or higher) and Android Build Tools 30.0.3 (or higher)

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Android SDK paths
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator
export CAPACITOR_ANDROID_STUDIO_PATH=/path/to/android-studio/bin/studio # set path accordingly
```

Reload your bash profile:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 4: Clone and Build the Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/peterrhone/LMSA.git
cd LMSA

# Install Capacitor dependencies
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/android

# Initialize Capacitor project
npm init -y
npx cap init LMSA com.example.lmsa --web-dir www

# Prepare web files
mkdir -p www
cp -r index.html css js assets icon.png www/

# Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# Configure for Android 8+ compatibility (SDK 26+)
# Edit android/variables.gradle to set minSdkVersion = 26

# Sync project
npx cap sync
```

### Step 5: Configure Credential Storage
To enable secure credential storage for authentication:

1. Install the Secure Storage Cordova plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install cordova-plugin-secure-storage-echo
   npx cap sync
   ```

2. The app uses this plugin to securely store authentication credentials.

3. The necessary permissions are automatically added to AndroidManifest.xml when you run `npx cap sync`:
   - INTERNET permission for network connectivity
   - Optional biometric permissions for secure storage access (if available on device)

   You don't need to manually edit the AndroidManifest.xml file as Capacitor handles this automatically.

### Step 6: Build and Run the APK
```bash
# Open the project in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
# 1. Click "Build" ‚Üí "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" ‚Üí "Build APK(s)"
# 2. Find the APK in android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Step 7: Install the APK on Your Device
Connect your Android device via USB (with USB debugging enabled) and run:
```bash
adb install ./android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## üåê Remote Access & Nginx Configuration

To enable secure remote access with HTTPS and Basic Authentication while resolving CORS issues, follow these steps:

### Setting Up Nginx with SSL and Basic Authentication

1. **Install Nginx and the headers-more module**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx apache2-utils
   sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-headers-more-filter  # Headers-more module
   
   # For CentOS/RHEL, use EPEL repository
   sudo yum install nginx nginx-mod-http-more
   sudo yum install httpd-tools  # For htpasswd utility
   ```

2. **Create a password file for authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new password file (replace 'username' with your desired username)
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
   
   # Add additional users (omit -c flag)
   sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd another_user
   ```

3. **Create SSL certificates** (or use Let's Encrypt):
   ```bash
   # Self-signed certificate for testing
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key \
     -out /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt
   ```

4. **Configure Nginx**:
   Create a configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio` with the following content:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name your.domain.com;  # Replace with your actual domain

  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key;
  
  # Strong SSL settings
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
  
  # Basic Authentication
  auth_basic "Restricted Access";
  auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1234;  # LM Studio server port
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Robust CORS headers for all requests
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,Origin,Accept';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true';

    # Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
      more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Type: text/plain charset=UTF-8';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Length: 0';
      return 204;
    }
  }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your.domain.com;
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

5. **Enable the site and restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Configure firewall** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   ```

### Connecting LMSA to Your Secure Server

1. Open the LMSA app
2. Go to Settings
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `https://your.domain.com`)
4. Enter username and password in the authentication section
5. Test the connection

### Security Notes

- Using Basic Authentication with HTTPS ensures your credentials are encrypted in transit
- The CORS headers allow the mobile app to communicate with your server
- For production use, consider obtaining a proper SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Regularly update your passwords for better security
- The headers-more module is required for proper CORS header handling
