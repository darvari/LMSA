## üÜï What's New
üéâ **Latest Update: Version 7.1** - August 2025

### New Features & Improvements
- **Settings Menu Fix**: Fixed an issue where the settings menu wasn't positioning itself correctly on some devices, ensuring consistent user experience across all device types
- **Performance Optimization**: The app has been fully optimized to run better on more devices with improved performance, reduced memory usage, and enhanced stability across different hardware configurations
- **System Prompts Feature**: The character feature has been replaced with the ability to save system prompts, providing a more flexible and powerful way to customize your AI interactions. You can now create, save, and manage multiple system prompts for different use cases
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Improved device compatibility and performance optimizations for a smoother experience across various Android devices

### Bug Fixes
- **CORS & Preflight Redirects:** Fixed persistent CORS errors by ensuring all requests use the correct protocol and port logic.
- **Android Build Parity:** Synced all Capacitor/Android build JS files with main codebase changes.

## üîÄ Changes in This Fork

This fork includes significant improvements to enable secure remote access to LM Studio servers:

### Server Connection Enhancements
- **Smart URL Construction**: Completely refactored API calls to use a centralized `getServerUrl()` function, ensuring consistent protocol and port handling across all requests
- **Domain Name Support**: Added support for domain names in addition to IP addresses
- **Automatic Protocol Detection**: The app now detects if a URL includes protocols (http/https) and adjusts settings accordingly
- **Authentication Support**: Added optional username/password authentication for secure remote access to LM Studio servers
  - Can be toggled on/off for both remote and local connections
  - Credentials are stored securely in localStorage
  - Multiple account support with different servers
- **Smart Port Handling**: 
  - Ports are omitted for standard protocols (port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS) to prevent browser redirect issues
  - Default port 443 is automatically used when SSL is enabled
  - Default port 1234 is used for non-SSL connections if no port is specified
- **Enhanced Security**: Non-local domains (anything not matching localhost/127.0.0.1/10.x.x.x/192.168.x.x/172.16-31.x.x) automatically use HTTPS for improved security
- **Server Response Testing**: Added a Test Server Response button to verify connectivity and display server status before attempting to chat

### Mobile UI Improvements
- **Field Validation**: Domain name input field has autocorrect and spellcheck disabled for more accurate entry
- **Visual Feedback**: Port field shows default values in grey when not explicitly set
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for connection issues, specifically addressing CORS and preflight redirect problems

### Previous Updates
- **Version 7.0**: Performance optimization, system prompts feature, and enhanced compatibility
- **Version 6.5**: Added scroll to bottom icon, improved welcome screen behavior, and comprehensive performance improvements
- **Version 5.5**: Added full Vision Language Model (VLM) support for image upload and analysis, enabling multimodal conversations with AI models
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved keyboard overlap issues, fixed PDF file attachments, and disabled auto-scroll feature for better chat experience

## üåê Remote Access & Nginx Configuration

To enable secure remote access with HTTPS and Basic Authentication while resolving CORS issues, follow these steps:

### Setting Up Nginx with SSL and Basic Authentication

1. **Install Nginx and the headers-more module**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx apache2-utils
   sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-headers-more-filter  # Headers-more module
   
   # For CentOS/RHEL, use EPEL repository
   sudo yum install nginx nginx-mod-http-more
   sudo yum install httpd-tools  # For htpasswd utility
   ```

2. **Create a password file for authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new password file (replace 'username' with your desired username)
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
   
   # Add additional users (omit -c flag)
   sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd another_user
   ```

3. **Create SSL certificates** (or use Let's Encrypt):
   ```bash
   # Self-signed certificate for testing
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key \
     -out /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt
   ```

4. **Configure Nginx**:
   Create a configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio` with the following content:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name your.domain.com;  # Replace with your actual domain

  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/your.domain.com.key;
  
  # Strong SSL settings
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
  
  # Basic Authentication
  auth_basic "Restricted Access";
  auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1234;  # LM Studio server port
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Robust CORS headers for all requests
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,Origin,Accept';
    more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true';

    # Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
      more_set_headers 'Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Type: text/plain charset=UTF-8';
      more_set_headers 'Content-Length: 0';
      return 204;
    }
  }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your.domain.com;
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

5. **Enable the site and restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/lmstudio /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Configure firewall** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   ```

### Connecting LMSA to Your Secure Server

1. Open the LMSA app
2. Go to Settings
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `your.domain.com`)
4. Enable SSL/HTTPS toggle
5. Enter username and password in the authentication section
6. Test the connection

### Security Notes

- Using Basic Authentication with HTTPS ensures your credentials are encrypted in transit
- The CORS headers allow the mobile app to communicate with your server
- For production use, consider obtaining a proper SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Regularly update your passwords for better security
- The headers-more module is required for proper CORS header handling
